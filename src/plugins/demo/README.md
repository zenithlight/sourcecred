# The Demo Plugin

This plugin exists for testing convenience. It's nice sometimes to have a super
lightweight plugin, with a few basic node types and a simple graph.

Note: This plugin is **not** intended to be a model for what a canonical plugin
would look like. It only exists to test code that depends on having some plugin
available.

The plugin is loosely based on the wonderful video game [Factorio], which the
SourceCred developers heartily recommend.

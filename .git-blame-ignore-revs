# List of commits that `git blame` should ignore.
#
# Include ONLY commits that are known to be no-ops, like automated
# reformattings.
#
# To properly format an entry, run
#
#     git show --no-patch --format='%H  # %s' COMMIT_HASH
#
# replacing `COMMIT_HASH` with the appropriate hash, or pass similar
# formatting to `git log`, etc.
#
# To use this file, ensure that you have Git 2.23 or later installed,
# then configure your repository to teach it about this file:
#
#     git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# See `git help blame` or `git help config` for details.
